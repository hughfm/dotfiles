# Hugh's dotfiles

Will need to manually install:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim)
- [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
- [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)

Manually run FZF installer for additional shell features:

```zsh
$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install
```
