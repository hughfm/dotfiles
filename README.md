# Hugh's dotfiles

Will need to manually install:

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
[oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
[zsh-autosuggestions](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)

coc-settings.json should be linked in ~/.config/nvim/coc-settings.json (can't
put a comment for this in the JSON file).

Manually run FZF installer for additional shell features:

```zsh
$(brew --prefix)/opt/fzf/install
```
